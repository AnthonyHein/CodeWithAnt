# Code with Ant

## Introduction

Code with Ant is program designed for aspiring computer science students to learn and engage with the art of coding. The program assumes basic familiarity with computers but nothing further. In fact, the author measures the success of this program by how accessible it is even to younger audiences, and so every every effort is made to realize this goal.

## What is Coding?

**Coding** is the practice of writing text files containing instructions that a computer can understand and perform.

You see, for however smart computers are, they cannot understand English the way that humans can; this is one place where humans still beat computers. For that reason, a text file of instructions, called "code", needs to use a particular set of tools and be formatted in a very predictable way so that a computer can understand it. Even the slightest deviation from these tools and formatting will cause the code to give an error.

Maybe it makes you frustrated that the code you write has to be so particular; certainly, it requires a lot of patience when you are just starting out. So, why would anyone want to code? Do people actually enjoy coding?

The answer is an enthusiastic yes! _I love coding._ I think one I think one reason I might enjoy coding so much is because it seems to be a nice blend of all the other subjects you may see in school.

- **History**: Coding is a _process_. It involves a lot of iteration as you deal with errors and improve the performance of your code. Even the most experienced coder cannot write the best code on the first try. So, just like history, coding involves a lot of reflection over what we have done previously and how we may apply that moving forward.
- **Foreign Language**: Coding is very similar to foreign language, but instead of translating between two _human_ languages, you are translating a human language into a computer language. There are the same challenges of miscommunication and the same moments of "Hm, what is the word I am looking for again?".
- **Mathematics**: Coding has the same formality as math. There is a well-defined goal and either your code can be correct or incorrect.
- **Literature and Arts**: Coding has the same creativity as literature. Even though code can only be correct or incorrect (and nothing in between), there are still infinitely many ways to write that code. The best coders not only write correct code, but they write short, readable, beautiful code.
- **Science**: Coding has helped advance science tremendously because the speed at which a computer runs code has allowed us to run enormous experiments. Without a computer, these experiments would not have been possible. One cool example is genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This is where scientists will look at the billions of base pairs in human DNA to try to identify which ones might be responsible for a disease. Imagine trying to look at billions of base pairs by hand? Impossible! But, a computer can execution _billions_ of instructions per second.
- **Craftsmanship**: Coding also revolves around building things just like a woodworking class would, the difference is just that you are building digital things when you code. Nonetheless, whether physical or digital, you still get that same sense of pride and ownership when you finish a project. One cool thing about coding is that you don't need a lot of resources to code. You only need a computer, that's it. No expensive machinery or resources.

In my opinion, coding draws the very best qualities from all these disciplines. So coding can actually be enjoyable, but is it necessary?

Absolutely, so many accomplishments of recent history are only possible because of coding. The ability to automate tasks have made this world so much more productive. When we ask humans to repeatedly do something, we observe a decline in quality as they get bored or tired. But, a computer doesn't experience this same fatigue; a computer is perfectly happy doing the same thing over and over again. Also, we can think about the availability of humans versus computers: it is unreasonable to ask a human to be available around the clock but computers can be running around the clock.

Alright, before we jump into code, we will discuss the "Dice Game"; which is what we will be working on during this program.

## Development Environment

### Python

There are many coding languages that a computer can understand. One coding language is **Python**. Compared to other programming languages, Python is _well-documented_, _easy to learn_, and _quick to code in_. This makes it perfect for our purposes. (Can anyone think of a reason that we might not want to use Python?)

### TBD

For writing our Python code we will use TODO.

## Input and Output

The first thing we need to talk about is how our code interacts with the outside world. If code never interacts with the outside world, we have no idea of knowing what it is doing! Is it even doing anything? Kind of like the expression: if a tree falls in the middle of the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make any sound?

So, code interacts with the outside world by reading input _from_ humans and producing output _for_ humans. We will go over each.
